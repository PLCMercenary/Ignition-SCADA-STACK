# Ignition and PostgreSQL

This Docker Compose solution utilizes the [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image to initialize a default PostgreSQL database for use with Ignition.

## Quick Start

See the sections later in this guide for more details on these commands, but this should get you running quickly if you're impatient üòù:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/thirdgen88/ignition-examples.git ignition-examples
Cloning into 'ignition-examples'..
$ cd ignition-examples/ignition-postgres  # Change to the PostgreSQL Example Folder
$ mkdir secrets
$ echo $(pwgen -1 32) | tee secrets/POSTGRES_PASSWORD  # The tee command will echo the generated password to stdout and write to file
thot1giengae3euzaiRiet7AiYo0viox
$ echo $(pwgen -1 32) | tee secrets/GATEWAY_PASSWORD

$ docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f  # Start the stack in detached mode and start to follow the logs (break with Ctrl-C)
...
```

## Connecting to the Database from Ignition

With the sidecar container arrangement, the `gateway` service is able to communicate with the `db` service by-name, without any other special configuration.

By default, the database port `5432` is published to port `5432` on your host computer for easy administration via pgAdmin, for example.  You can either change that port mapping definition to specify an alternative port for the host (e.g. "8432:5432" in order to route host port `8432` into the container's port `5432`) or comment it out altogether if you don't need external connectivity to the database.  The Ignition container will still be able to communicate with the `db` container via the internal network created by `docker-compose up`.

On the Ignition Gateway configuration webpage, use the following settings for connecting to the database container:

## Container Customization

Take a look at the README's for both the [postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [kcollins/ignition](http://hub.docker.com/r/kcollins/ignition) Docker images for information on how to customize the containers.

Using the guidance there, you can do some other interesting things with this stack, such as:

- Placing a `sqldump-xxx.sql.gz` PostgreSQL dump file in `db-init` folder to have the backup restored automatically on first-launch.
- Placing customized `.sql` or `.sql.gz` or `.sh` script files in `db-init` folder to have those files processed during first-launch.

## Setting up the Secrets

Before you start this stack, you need to define some secrets.  The [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file is configured to look for files in the `secrets` folder: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for the database, and `GATEWAY_PASSWORD` for the Ignition gateway.  If you're on macOS or Linux, you can use the pwgen^1 utility to seed these password files with the commands below:

```bash
$ echo $(pwgen -1 32) | tee secrets/POSTGRES_PASSWORD
thot1giengae3euzaiRiet7AiYo0viox
$ echo $(pwgen -1 32) | tee secrets/GATEWAY_PASSWORD

```

Alternatively, simple place a password of your choosing in the files with a standard text editor.

## Starting the Services

Bring up the services with the command below:

    docker-compose up -d

This will start the containers in detached mode.  If you wish to monitor the log output of the containers:

    docker-compose logs -f

Use `CTRL-C` to break out of the log view.

## Shutting down the Services

To shut everything down and stop/remove containers and networks that were created in the _up_ process:

    docker-compose down

Since the relevant data for each of the containers is stored in volumes, the removal of the containers won't delete the state of your database or Ignition Gateway.

**USE WITH CAUTION**: If you also want to remove all of the volumes associated with your containers, know that this will reset to an initial state:

    docker-compose down -v
