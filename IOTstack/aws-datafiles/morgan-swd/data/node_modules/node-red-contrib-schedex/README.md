# Schedex

Scheduler for node-red which allows you to enter on/off times as 24hr clock (e.g. 01:10) or suncalc events (e.g.
goldenHour). It also allows you to offset times and randomise the time within the offset.

Inspired by Pete Scargill's [BigTimer](http://tech.scargill.net/big-timer/)

**NOTE: When upgrading from versions prior to 1.0.0, you will see a message for each Schedex node in the Node-RED debug
window. This message is to advise that the Schedex configuration changed slightly in version 1.0.0 in order to
accomodate days of the week when scheduling. To remedy, simply edit each Schedex node, tick the days of the week you
want Schedex enabled and re-deploy.**

# Installation

This node requires node 4.x. It's tested against 4.6.1.

    $ cd ~/.node-red
    $ npm install node-red-contrib-schedex

# Configuration

## Schedule

The scheduling days allow you to choose which days of the week to schedule events. Unticking all days will suspend
scheduling.

## Suspending scheduling

The 'Suspend scheduling' checkbox allows you to disable time scheduling. If scheduling is suspended, Schedex will only
generate output events upon receipt of input 'on' and 'off' events (see below).

This setting is provided for the situation where you temporarily don't want time based activation and don't want to
rewire your Node-RED flow.

## Times

The times can be a 24 hour time or a [suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) event:

| Time              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `00:00 ... 23:59` | 24hr time                                                                |
| `sunrise`         | sunrise (top edge of the sun appears on the horizon)                     |
| `sunriseEnd`      | sunrise ends (bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon)                |
| `goldenHourEnd`   | morning golden hour (soft light, best time for photography) ends         |
| `solarNoon`       | solar noon (sun is in the highest position)                              |
| `goldenHour`      | evening golden hour starts                                               |
| `sunsetStart`     | sunset starts (bottom edge of the sun touches the horizon)               |
| `sunset`          | sunset (sun disappears below the horizon, evening civil twilight starts) |
| `dusk`            | dusk (evening nautical twilight starts)                                  |
| `nauticalDusk`    | nautical dusk (evening astronomical twilight starts)                     |
| `night`           | night starts (dark enough for astronomical observations)                 |
| `nadir`           | nadir (darkest moment of the night, sun is in the lowest position)       |
| `nightEnd`        | night ends (morning astronomical twilight starts)                        |
| `nauticalDawn`    | nautical dawn (morning nautical twilight starts)                         |
| `dawn`            | dawn (morning nautical twilight ends, morning civil twilight starts)     |

## Offsets

The on and off time can have an offset. This is specified in minutes:

* -ve number brings the time forward. E.g. if the time is dusk and offset is -60, a message will be generated 60 minutes
  before dusk.
* +ve number delays the time by the specified number of minutes

## Randomisation of times

Both on and off times can be randomised by ticking "Use random time within offset period". For example, if you specify
dusk with an offset of -60 minutes, every day a message will be generated at a random time in a 60 minute window before
dusk.

## Inputs

You can wire inject nodes to the input of this node and send the following in `msg.payload`.

| msg.payload | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `on`        | Triggers manual on mode and causes Schedex to emit the configured on event. Manual mode is reset when the next on or off time is reached   |
| `off`       | Triggers manual off mode and causes Schedex to emit the configured off event. Manual mode is reset when the next on or off time is reached |
| `info`      | Schedex emits an object containing the on and off times in UTC format. It also contains the state which is either on or off.               |

'## Programmatic Control

This node supports programmatic time control as well as configuration via the NodeRED UI.

**It is very important to note that properties set programmatically in this manner are transient. They will not persist
over a NodeRED restart or redeploy!**

Note that both the property-based and string-based specifications are overrides that violate the usual behavior. 
See here for further discussion https://github.com/node-red/node-red/issues/399.

You can set the following:

| Property                      | Type                                                                  |
