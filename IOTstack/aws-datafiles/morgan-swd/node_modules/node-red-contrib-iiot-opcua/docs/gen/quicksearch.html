DebugDebugging on remote devices is important to help users. The verbose logging provides interesting points in different abstractions if IDE or console debugging is not possible. Start debug with Node-RED in verbose (-v) mode to get a verbose logging: DEBUG=opcuaIIoT* node-red -v 1&gt;nodeREDIIoTOPCUA.log 2&gt;&amp;1or on local Node-RED DEBUG=opcuaIIoT* node red.js -v 1&gt;nodeREDIIoTOPCUAServer.log 2&gt;&amp;1Debug OptionsPlease, read the Wiki article WikiFollow the white rabbit!
